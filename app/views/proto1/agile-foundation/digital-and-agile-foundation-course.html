        <div>
          <p>
          Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end. However, agile principles can be applied to a range of services, and can be adapted to suit many working environments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <p>
       You will learn about the different phases of service design – introducing agile delivery methods and tools / techniques. You will apply your learning in a simulated project environment and on completion will be familiar with agile methodology & terminology.
        </p>

        <summary><span class="summary">Assessment</span></summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            This is a City and Guilds accredited course, meaning you will receive a certificate upon completion.
          </p>
          <p>
            To successfully complete the course you will need to pass two short online tests held on day 4 and day 8. These tests are multiple-choice and each have a pass mark of 10 out of 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not achieve the pass mark for either test, you will have the opportunity to re-sit the test a total of 2 times and the delivery manager will support you with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tests are important to ensure you have understood the course, but you will also receive feedback on your Agile skills throughout the practical exercises.
          </p>
